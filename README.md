TODO:

notes/ideas:
- give the footer a height or padding and tweak bg color to be darker w/ opacity? maybe the light blue from the gear
- i think it would be nice to have the bg image aligned to the bottom, starting just above the footer. its trickier to implement responsive but it will look more centered and the focus will be more easily directed to the cards. the fact that image has a straight bottom should make it look very clean and neat if settled on top of a straight footer box
- add margin-top for the wrapper or whatevever you are using for the content below the header. it might have to be breakpoint dependent but centering the container that holds the content, at any width, would go a long way imo and maybe a bit more visual indicator for clickable buttons. even just a border with an offset for nav buttons would go a long way, but hover effects are always a nice touch

- ya for sure. if you got for white bg for cards, maybe add some opacity to the color so you can see the background image when in mobile rn the cards obscure it. or you could, on mobile, not render the bg image at all and instead add the shop to the card's bg image
for the get in touch page, add a bg to the subheader and a margin to the content wrapper, the cards stretch out to the edge of view port. you could even implement a form to automatically send an email to rick or something too, if you want something to pad out that page. but you could also open up to spam so maybe not
spinny gears are nice
about is a blank page


you can do it. just go low and slow and take it piece by piece. its in a good place now you just need to refine it. think about every route as its own contained thing, youve already implemented enough modularity and reusability insofar as components that you just need to make each specific implementation shine for its own purpose

equipment cards would look nice if arranged in a list that on click shows the image and the copy. and push the list down a third of the page and add a little flavour text box explicating on what value the tools have

its fine to have tools the tools and even better to describe the tools individually but what about copy that sells how Beothuck uses the tools to add value
